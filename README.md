# Catechism-project
This is really a labor of love, as well as a huge learning experience for me! The project consists of creating an entire new web site for the Redeemer Catechism. 
It is currently hosted as a wordpress site, but I wanted to challenge myself in bringing a bit more of a modern look to it.
